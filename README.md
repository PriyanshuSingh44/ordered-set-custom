# ordered-set-custom

A simple utility to create ordered sets from iterables in Python.

This package helps you remove duplicates while preserving the original order of elements — like a set, but in order!

## Installation

```bash
pip install ordered-set-custom
```

Why use this?
Python’s set() is fast but unordered.
This package is perfect when you care about both uniqueness and order — like processing user input, logs, config files, etc.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
